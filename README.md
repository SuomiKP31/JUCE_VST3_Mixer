# JUCE_VST3_Mixer
Project for UVic CSC561 (Ongoing)
This project aims to program a toy project using JUCE Framework.
Ideally it should be able to apply some audio effects in real time, do filtering and play some launchpad samples.

## Update Oct 22, 2023
Added basic GUI frameworks and Cut Filters, this part is mostly from a Freecodecamp Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Iq4_Kd7Rc)
However, since we are going a different direction, I made some changes and preparations for effectors. A new component is created to hold effector buttons, another new one will be added in the future to host launchpads.
